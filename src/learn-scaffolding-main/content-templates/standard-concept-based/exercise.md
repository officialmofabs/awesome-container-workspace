<!-- 1. Topic sentences ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Remind the user of the core concepts from the preceding concept unit without mentioning the
          details of the exercise or the scenario.

    Heading: None

    Example: "In sorted data, elements are ordered by name, size, or another characteristic that a
             comparison operator can work with."

-->
TODO: Add your topic sentences.

<!-- 2. Scenario subtask ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that the exercise covers.

    Heading: Optional

    Position: Position this content according to its length. Either place it in a separate paragraph, or
              combine it with the previous section into a single paragraph.

    Example: "In the sales company scenario, the manager needs to track sales volume. Sorting the sales
             data can make it easy to spot low-performing areas."

    Recommended: Add an image that summarizes the entire scenario and highlights the area that this
                 exercise implements.

TODO: Optionally, add your scenario image.

<!-- 3. Task performed in the exercise -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what the learner implements in the exercise. Describe the end state after
          completion.

    Heading: Optional

    Position: Position this content according to its length. Either place it in a separate paragraph, or
              combine it with the previous section into a single paragraph.

    Example: "In this exercise, you sort data in a spreadsheet. Within a column, the lowest values move
             to the top, and the greatest values move to the bottom."

    Optional: Include an image that shows the end state.
-->
TODO: Describe the end state.
TODO: Optionally, add an image.

<!-- 4. Chunked steps ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the steps the user takes to complete the exercise.

    Structure: Break the steps into chunks, where each chunk has three parts:
        1. A heading describing the goal of the chunk.
        2. An introductory paragraph describing the goal of the chunk at a high level.
        3. Numbered steps. If possible, use seven or fewer steps in each chunk.

    Example:
        "## Sort data by size

        When you analyze data, you can order the data by size to quickly see the minimum and maximum
        values.

        1. In the spreadsheet, select all the data in the **Region** and **Sales volume** columns.
        2. Select **Data** > **Sort**.
        3. In the pop-up window, under **Column**, select **Sales volume**.
        4. Under **Order**, select **Smallest to Largest**.
        5. Examine the data in the **Sales volume** column. Note that the minimum value is at the top of
           the column, and the maximum value is at the bottom."

<!-- Pattern for chunks. Repeat as needed. -->
## TODO: Add your chunk heading.
TODO: Add your chunk introduction paragraph.

1. TODO: Add the first step.
1. TODO: Add the second step.
1. ...
1. TODO: Add the last step.

<!-- 5. Validation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Enable the learner to evaluate whether they completed the exercise correctly.

    Heading: "## Check your work"

    Structure:
        1. An introductory paragraph describing how the user validates their work at a high level
        2. Numbered steps, if the user needs to perform multiple steps to verify success
        3. An optional video of an expert performing the exact steps of the exercise

    Example:
        "## Check your work

        The data is now sorted by sales volume. To verify that the data is ordered correctly, we'll look
        at individual values in this column.

        1. In the **Sales volume** column, check that the first value is less than the second value.
        2. Move down one row, and check that the second value is less than the third value.
        3. Continue moving down rows in the **Sales volume** column and checking that each value is less
           than the one below it.
        4. When you reach the last row and have verified that each value is less than the one below it,
           the validation is complete."
-->
## Check your work
TODO: Add your introduction paragraph.

1. TODO: Add the first step.
1. TODO: Add the second step.
1. ...
1. TODO: Add the last step.

TODO: Optionally, add your exercise solution video.
