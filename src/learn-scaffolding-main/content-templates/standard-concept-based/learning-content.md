<!-- 1. Topic sentences ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Briefly summarize the concepts that this unit teaches.

    Heading: None

    Example: "In addition to tables, a relational database can contain other structures that help to
             optimize data organization, encapsulate programmatic actions, and improve the speed of access."

-->
TODO: Add your topic sentences.

<!-- 2. Scenario subtask ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that the content in this unit solves.

    Heading: None

    Position: Combine this content with the topic sentences into a single paragraph.

    Example: "In the sales company scenario, we can use normalization to minimize duplication and enforce
             integrity in the inventory and order data."
-->
TODO: Add your scenario subtask.

<!-- 3. Prose table of contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what the unit covers.

    Heading: None

    Position: Combine this statement with the topic sentences and scenario subtask into a single paragraph.

    Example: "In this unit, you'll learn about three of these structures in more detail: views, stored
             procedures, and indexes."
-->
TODO: Write your prose table of contents.

<!-- 4. Motivation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide motivation for learning the concepts in the unit.

    Heading: None

    Position: Position this content according to its length. Either place it in a separate paragraph, or
              combine it with the previous section into a single paragraph.

    Example: "Redundant data wastes disk space and creates maintenance problems. If data that exists in
             more than one place must be changed, the data must be changed in the same way in all
             locations. An address change is much easier to implement if that data is stored only in one
             table and nowhere else in the database."
-->
TODO: Add your motivation.

<!-- 5. Chunked content ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to understand a concept.

    Structure: Break the content into chunks, where each chunk has the following parts:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading of <concept>
        2. A transition from a previous concept if this chunk isn't the first one
        3. A definition of the concept
        4. Examples or counterexamples that illustrate the concept
